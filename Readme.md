# sol (state oriented language)

## Welcome to sol (pronounced with a long o)

The principle of this programming language is the usage of states, just like
modeling finite automata. Therefore it has a more functional approach and
utilizes its functionality and determinism. However the use of states makes it
more unike and allows a more precise and secure program, ensuring the program
is only able to do what you tell it to.

syntax.
